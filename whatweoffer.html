 <p>The Stroke Wellness Center provides an open space and equipment for stroke survivors to participate in generalized movements and exercises to promote overall physical health. <br><br>

Examples of exercises include:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp;Yoga for people to stretch and meditate <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp;Dancing to increase heart rate and mobility <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp;Light weight training to increase overall strength <br><br>

Many people hate going to a traditional gym because of the judgement that comes along with it. It’s scary to have so many muscular people looking at you struggle to run a mile. If young, healthy people feel judged at the gym, what about those who are struggling to adapt to their new limitations? The Stroke Wellness Center aims to provide a safe space where survivors can complete their rehab without being afraid to fall, use light weights, or make a mistake, because everyone in the room has similar limitations. Even though the center does not offer healthcare services, by motivating people to improve their overall physical health, the exercise space will hopefully help prevent future strokes and increase the chances of a better recovery.

         <p>The Stroke Wellness Center offers weekly support groups for survivors to not only share their experiences with others, but also make connections with people in their community that will last a lifetime. As much as we would like to, the center cannot solve survivors' physical situations as we are not medical professionals. What we can do is provide survivors with support systems that will last beyond the duration of their physical limitations. Stroke recovery is a long, hard journey, only made worse without a solid support system to fall back on and use as motivation to continue with it. By providing a space where survivors can interact with each other and with volunteers both in the gym space and in the support group, the center hopes to give people a community that they can turn to no matter what happens in their futures.</p>

          <p>Each survivor determines what they make out of the resources the Stroke Wellness Center provides. All exercises and social interaction will be overseen by both undergraduate and graduate volunteers who have been trained to assist if something goes wrong, but patients determine what exercises they do, who they talk to, and what they want to get out of their experience. Upon arrival to the clinic, survivors choose whether they want to work out, go to a support group session, or just sit and talk with other people in the center. Volunteers are open ears for anything survivors want to talk about if people want to rant about their week, talk about their lives, or just have a conversation with someone. The center serves as a place for survivors to have a safe space to look forward to coming to each week, and hopefully gives them reasons to wake up in the morning. </p>
